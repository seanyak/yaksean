# Sean's Portfolio

Hi, I'm Sean. I'm a web developer. I love to design & develop, with a focus on React (Next.js).

## About Me

My journey in the tech world kicked off back in Web 1.0, where I dabbled in crafting static websites. I created sites as a hobby for friends and eventually for bands and record labels. My passion for music took precedent and as I began playing music more, I worked on websites less.

Fast forward to 2020, I decided to make a career shift and go all-in on Web Development. I enrolled in classes online at HarvardX, through edX, as well as freeCodeCamp and learned full-stack web development. My favorite thing about web development is the ability to creatively solve problems with code.

My core stack is React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am also familiar with TypeScript and Laravel. I'm always hungry to learn and master new tech. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a developer. When I'm not coding, I enjoy creating music, discovering new grooves, coaching youth soccer, watching footy, and hanging with the fam at the beach. Let's make something!
